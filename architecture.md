# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the Secure Static Website Deployment on AWS.

## Components

1. **EC2 Instance**: Hosts the static website content using Apache web server.
2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic and handles SSL termination.
3. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: Provides SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.
4. **Route 53**: Manages DNS and routes traffic to the ALB.
5. **Security Group**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic for the EC2 instance and ALB.

## Architecture Diagram

                         [ACM Certificate]
```

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS is enforced using ACM certificate.
- Security group limits inbound traffic to ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 22 (SSH).
- EC2 instance is not directly accessible from the internet; all traffic goes through the ALB.

## Scalability

- The use of an ALB allows for easy scaling by adding more EC2 instances to the target group.
- The architecture can be extended to use Auto Scaling Groups for automatic scaling based on demand.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a CDN using Amazon CloudFront for improved global performance.
- Set up monitoring and alerting using Amazon CloudWatch.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments of website content.
